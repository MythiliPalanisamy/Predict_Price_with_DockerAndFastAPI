This project @ BeCode.org as part of the AI Bootcamp in Gent.

## Description:
The project is about 
* cleaning the data scrapped data from 'https://www.immoweb.be/en'.
* analysing the cleaned data.
* come to conclusion with data visualisation.

## Installation:
* create a new repo. 
* create new environment in the path where you needed.
* install numpy, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot with 'pip install numpy'.
* create '.gitignore' and include new environment in it.

## Usage:

This project contains notebooks that has data cleaning process and few intrepretations to get clear view of data.
It is used to get clear view about few types of data visualisation, data cleaning process and a way to nalyse data.

For reference:

1. data_cleaning.ipynb - contains step by step process to clean 10,000 data.

2. data_analysis.ipynb - contains details about the data which is being used in the form of visualisation (to get better view).
- how many rows anad columns the data has.
- correlation between variables.
- percentage of missing values per column in heatmap.

3. data_interpretation.ipynb - contains few interpreted data.
- The outliers.
- The number of properties according to their surface using a histogram.
- In my opinion, which 5 variables are the most important and why?
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)

4. My_interpretation.ipynb - contains some of my findings.
- In every heating type how many houses are in each energy class.
- Correlation between bedroom and bathroom.
- Number of houses with heating type in each province.
- Number of bedrooms and price correlation(with and without outliers).
- Relation between price and Energy class.
- Relation between price and Bathrooms.
- Relation between price, construction year and building condition as hue.
- Relation between price and building condition (with and without outliers).
- mean value of few variables.
